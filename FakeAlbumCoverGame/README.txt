The FakeAlbumCoverGame.py is a code that is required to built to complete the Coursera course "Python for Data Science." This program gets two titles of randomly-generated Wikipedia pages and uses them as the title of a music album and the name of a band. The names are put on a randomly-generated picture. Every time you run the program, a different album cover will be obtained. In order to run this program, you might want to change a path for fonts at first.
